# Brain Tumor Detection

This repository contains code for detecting brain tumors using various machine learning models. The project aims to accurately classify brain images into tumor and non-tumor categories using machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

Brain tumors pose a significant health risk and timely detection is crucial for effective treatment. Machine learning algorithms offer a promising approach to assist in the automated detection of brain tumors from medical images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of brain images obtained from medical scans. It comprises images of both tumor and non-tumor cases, allowing for the training and evaluation of machine learning models.

## Models Implemented

1. **Random Forest Classifier**: A popular ensemble learning method used for classification tasks. It combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple yet effective algorithm for classification based on similarity measures. It classifies a data point by a majority vote of its neighbors.
3. **Decision Tree Classifier**: A tree-like model where an internal node represents a feature, the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome.

## Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the effectiveness of each model in accurately detecting brain tumors.
